  <h1>Welcome to the Arithmetic Module</h1>

  <p>
    In this module, you’ll learn the fundamentals of <b>computer arithmetic</b> —
    how numbers are <b>represented</b>, <b>converted</b>, and <b>manipulated</b>
    across different bases such as binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll also explore how computers perform <b>arithmetic operations</b>,
    represent <b>signed values</b> using sign-magnitude and two’s complement,
    and understand the effects of <b>overflow</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you move through each section, your <b>AI tutor</b> can help explain
    anything on this page.

  <h2>Sections Overview</h2>

  <h3>Number Systems</h3>
  <p>
    Learn how computers represent numbers in binary, octal, decimal, and
    hexadecimal systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Signed Representations</h3>
  <p>
    Understand how negative numbers are represented using sign-magnitude
    and two’s complement systems, enabling both positive and negative arithmetic.
  </p>

  <h3>Arithmetic Operations</h3>
  <p>
    Explore how addition and subtraction are performed in binary, and how
    carries and borrows are handled at the bit level.
  </p>

  <h3>Overflow</h3>
  <p>
    Discover how overflow occurs when arithmetic exceeds bit limits.
  </p>

  <h3>Arithmetic Calculator</h3>
  <p>
    Use the calculator to perform arithmetic operations, identify cases
    of overflow, and analyze the underlying causes with AI assistance.
