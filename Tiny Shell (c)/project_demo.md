# Demo Video for tsh — Tiny Shell

## Overview

A demo video explaining how to build, run, and test the `tsh` (Tiny Shell) project has been uploaded to YouTube. In the video, we demonstrate:

- **Building**: compiling the code with `make`.  
- **Running**: launching `./tsh` and interacting with the shell prompt.  
- **Built‑in Commands**: `quit`, `jobs`, `bg`, `fg`.  
- **Job Control**: foreground vs background
- **Signal Handling**: sending `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+Z` to jobs.  
- **I/O Redirection**: `<`, `>`, and combined usage.  
- **Pipelines**: linking commands with `|`.  
- **Cleanup**: how zombie processes are handled.

You can view the demo video to see each feature in action and understand expected behavior.
